    // The severity levels have the following meaning:
    //   *0-Danger*             Indicates lives are potentially in danger. Urgent attention is needed and action should be taken immediately.
    //   *1-Hardware Failure*   Indicates that the Charging Station is unable to continue regular operations due to Hardware issues. Action is required.
    //   *2-System Failure*     Indicates that the Charging Station is unable to continue regular operations due to software or minor hardware issues. Action is required.
    //   *3-Critical*           Indicates a critical error. Action is required.
    //   *4-Error*              Indicates a non-urgent error. Action is required.
    //   *5-Alert*              Indicates an alert event. Default severity for any type of monitoring event.
    //   *6-Warning*            Indicates a warning event. Action may be required.
    //   *7-Notice*             Indicates an unusual event. No immediate action is required.
